## 🛠️ Dependencies

- [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/)  

All required dependencies are included in `package.json`.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Base URL for tests should be set in `cypress.config.js`, for example:
  ```javascript
  const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

  module.exports = defineConfig({
    e2e: {
      baseUrl: "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com"
    }
  });
  ```
- Locators for all pages are maintained in `support/locators.js` for easy maintainability.  
- Tests are designed to be **independent** and use Cypress best practices.
